What was this project helpful for to me?
  1. Training my eye to identify design choices, like colour differences and spacing, more clearly.
  2.

What to use for following projects:
  1. Make use of the option to comment out code and leave notes this way even more often - so helpful to mark lines/segments to come back to.
  2. For the style guide, use these guiding questions:
    2.1 Accurate? - compare to desired/original design
    2.2 Responsive? - check different screen sizes
    2.3 Accessible?
      2.3.1 Use alt for images
      2.3.2 Use clear structure, check if possibility to navigate everything with keyboard
      2.3.3 Consider design choices, e.g. high contrast
      2.3.4 Esp. for mobile: elements must be arranged in a way that makes them easy to tap (concerning centering + margins etc.)
